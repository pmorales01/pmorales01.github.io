<h2 class="text-blue-600 text-xl font-bold">Project Summary</h2>
<p>Group Project for Web Front-End Engineering. Used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement a single-page website for the game Hangman while adhering to JavaScript Standard Style. 
    Tailwind CSS was used for styling the game elements and the layout of the webpage.
